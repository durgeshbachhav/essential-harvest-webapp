These both come through distillation and account for the traditionally known benefits of rose hydrosol for the skin. Our Rose hydrosol may contain some natural sediments making it appear cloudy or look like tiny floating particles in the water. This is a result of natural waxes/essential oil compounds that settle out of the distillate water and occurs after fine filtration. It does not indicate any deterioration in quality.',
