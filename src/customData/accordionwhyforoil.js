         ` Steam distillation is preferred for the extraction
         of the essential oils because it ensures that the
         volatile aromatic compounds of the plant are
         collected in the end product. Distillation of plant
         parts (such as leaves, buds, flowers, and peels)
         at low temperatures ensure that the best quality
         essential oil is extracted.
