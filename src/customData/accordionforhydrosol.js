               'Steam distilled, rose geranium hydrosol contains both microscopic particles of rose geranium essential oil, and water-soluble plant compounds. These both come through distillation and account for the traditionally known benefits of rose geranium hydrosol for the skin. Our Rose geranium hydrosol may contain some natural sediments making it appear cloudy or look like tiny floating particles in the water. This is a result of natural waxes/essential oil compounds that settle out of the distillate water and occur after fine filtration. It does not indicate any deterioration in quality',
